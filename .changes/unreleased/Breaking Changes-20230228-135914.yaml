kind: Breaking Changes
body: This breaking change makes sure extra logic for parsing the precision, scale
  or charsize from a data type is only executed when the data type is a varchar, char
  or decimal. This way, timestamps remain unaltered. Before this breaking change,
  timestamps would lose their precision when constructing them with `from_description`.
